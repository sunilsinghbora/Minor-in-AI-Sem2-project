  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Financial markets are complex and influenced by many factors. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that forecasts future stock prices using historical market data. Accurate short-term predictions can support better trading decisions and risk management. This project focuses on predicting daily closing prices for a selected stock or index using time-series modeling techniques and evaluating model performance using standard error metrics.
  </p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    The project follows a structured methodology to transform raw market data into reliable forecasts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data collection:</strong> Obtain historical price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) from public APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance) or CSV files covering a representative time window.</li>
    <li><strong>Data preprocessing:</strong> Handle missing values, remove outliers, and create derived features such as returns, moving averages (MA), exponential moving averages (EMA), volatility measures, and lagged price features. Apply scaling (MinMax or StandardScaler) to normalize inputs for neural networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Train/test split:</strong> Use a time-aware split (training period followed by validation and test periods) to avoid look-ahead bias. Consider walk-forward validation for robust evaluation.</li>
    <li><strong>Model selection:</strong> Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to capture sequential dependencies. Example architecture: two LSTM layers (64 and 32 units) followed by a dense output layer. Use mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function and Adam optimizer.</li>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> Train the model on multi-step or single-step forecasting depending on the chosen horizon. Use early stopping on validation loss and checkpoint best weights. Tune hyperparameters such as look-back window size, batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Evaluate model predictions using metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²). Visualize predicted vs actual prices and residuals to inspect model behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tool and Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    The following tools and technologies are used to implement and validate the solution:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming language: Python</li>
    <li>Data manipulation: pandas, numpy</li>
    <li>Modeling and deep learning: TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch</li>
    <li>Preprocessing and metrics: scikit-learn</li>
    <li>Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn</li>
    <li>Development environment: Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab</li>
    <li>Version control: Git and GitHub</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    Example results (replace these placeholders with your actual project outputs): The LSTM-based model was able to capture short-term trends and deliver reasonable point forecasts on the test set. Example evaluation on the held-out test period:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>RMSE: 2.37 (price units)</li>
    <li>MAE: 1.85</li>
    <li>R²: 0.92</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Visual inspection of predicted vs actual price charts shows that the model follows the main price movements but may lag around sharp reversals. Residual analysis indicates a near-zero mean with slightly larger variance during high-volatility periods. Performance can be improved by incorporating additional exogenous features (e.g., technical indicators, macroeconomic signals) or ensembling multiple models.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for stock price prediction using LSTM neural networks. The methodology—from data collection and preprocessing to modeling and evaluation—provides a repeatable framework for forecasting tasks. While the model delivers useful short-term forecasts, limitations include sensitivity to market regime changes, limited interpretability of deep models, and potential overfitting to historical patterns. Future work should explore feature enrichment, regularization strategies, alternative architectures (e.g., Transformer-based models), and a deployment pipeline for live inference.
